Welcome to my e-commerce website like amazon built using TypeScript . From building this I learned how develop and deploy a full-stack app like amazon using MERN Stack and TypeScript language.

**achievments**

- Creating react application by Vite in TypeScript
- Defining and exporting Types like product, orders and user in frontend
- Creating e-commerce pages like cart, checkout and place order using React Router Dom
- Using React hooks to handle form inputs and fetch backend api
- Managing and monitoring application state by React Context
- Handling shopping cart using reducers and local storage
- Building backend web api by node.js, express.js and MongoDB
- Handling authentication and authorization using JsonWebToken and express middleware.
- Deploying your application on cloud servers like render.com

Also I learned how to apply cloud services like

- PayPal and Stipe for online payment,
- Render for deployment
- Google Map for locate customer address on map
- Mailgun to email order receipt to user
