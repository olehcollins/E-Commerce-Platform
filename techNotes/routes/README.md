- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @olehcollins
- This was my very first project built using the MERN stack. The process was challenging, yet enlightening, as I delved deep into the intricacies of Node, Express, and React. For instance, mastering the construction of nested routes and implementing user authentication were pivotal achievements. This project served as a profound learning experience, laying a solid foundation for future MERN endeavors. Anticipation brews for the next undertaking â€“ and rest assured, it will be BIG!
